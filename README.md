Hey! I'm Sergey. I was born in Russia, raised in the Far East. For the last 10 years I've been living and working in Rostov-on-Don.

I've been programming in TS/JS for more than 10 years. Previosly worked as a engineer for a telecom company.
For a last couple of years i'm mainly focused in web development with React + RTK stack for fintech projects. 
Also engaged in processes automation and DevOps with Kubernetes stack.
Sometimes I work with software architectural design issues.

I do not agree with the decisions of my Government. Especially with a military operation in Ukraine.
I want to improve my English and it prevents me from moving right now.
